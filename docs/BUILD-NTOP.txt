Quick Instructions
==================

1. Get and install mandatory packages/tools

      These instructions assume your system is already provided with
      the normal source compile tools.  Most are gnu packages, available 
      through http://www.gnu.org or your favorite prebuilt package source.

      Using their RedHat package names, these are:

         - glibc, glibc-devel, gcc, cpp
         - gawk
         - autoconf (2.51+), automake (1.6+), libtool (1.4+)
               Note that there are reports of success with libtool 1.3.x
               Also note that there is special handling required
                   for automake 1.7.1+ - read the ./configure output.
         - openssl, openssl-devel (http://www.openssl.org)
         - gdbm, gdbm-devel
         - libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org)


2. Build ntop

   - cd ntop
   - ./configure
   - make
   - make install

2.1 Build a static ntop

    Sometimes you want to build ntop statically so that both shared libraries
    and plugins are included in the main program. In order to do that you need
    to:

    - cd ntop
    - ./configure --enable-static-plugins
    - make sntop

    The final binary is called sntop (static ntop).


3. Run ntop (See 1STRUN.txt)

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -A -u userid -P directory

          where  userid is the *nix userid you've created - with minimal
                 permissions - to run ntop
                 directory is the directory path where ntop will store
                 it's databases

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -u userid -P directory ...other parameters...

Note: Following these instructions builds static linked versions of
      required libraries (gdchart, gd, libpng and libz).  If other versions
      are already installed, you'll see messages in the ./configure output.

      The problem is that across the universe of *nix systems, libraries
      get installed in many different locations, making the Makefile
      incredibly complex.  If ntop can't find things, you will have to
      explicitly tell ./configure where to find them via a series of
      --with-xxxx-root=dir parameters.
