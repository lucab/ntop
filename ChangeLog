  an hugly picture.

Enhancements:
- Changed configure structure and improved checkings
  (Courtesy of Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com>)
- ntop_win32.[ch] are now part of the distribution.
- Options '-p' and '-F' accept both inline values or a file name

-------------------------

1.2a11 [Snapshot]

Fixed bugs:
- Dropped use of values.h in favour of limits.h and float.h
  (Courtesy of Stan Brown <stanb@awod.com>)
- Added configure flag (--enable-curses [default=yes]) for
  preventing ntop from using curses if present.y

Enhancements:
- Added SSL support via OpenSSL (www.openssl.org) if
  installed. I've included a simple ntop-cert.pem file
  that a certificate I created using OpenSSL. You should NOT
  use it in an idead world. Nevertheless, if you really wanna
  use it when ntop (with SSL support) starts up and it prompts
  'Enter PEM pass phrase:' you should type the seed
  I used for generating this test certificate, namely
  '*****'. (see fix for 1.2a13)
- Added ability to specify '*' (all URLs) for protecting
  all URLs.
- "make install" has been implemented

-------------------------

1.2a10 [Snapshot]

Fixed bugs:

Enhancements:
- Use of cascading style sheets

  the sorted column name
- If you put an html/statsicons/flags/<domain>.gif
  then when ntop shows the flag for <domain> it uses
  the <domain>.gif icon instead of the default one
  (Owner: Ross Campbell <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>)
- Added menu entry for shutting down ntop using
  a web browser
- Added the 's' flag that's used to specify the hash
  table size: the smaller is the value the less memory
  is used -> the less efficient is the hash ->
  the slower is ntop. Life is a matter of tradeoffs!
- Added lastSeenPlugin.c written by
  Andrea Marangoni <marangoni@unimc.it>. This plugins
  is a work in progess (as ntop :-)). Many thanks Andrea!

- ntop looks for *.html/gif/jpeg files in the local html/
  directory if such files have not been found elsewhere
  (e.g. /etc/ntop).

  (Courtesy of Rainer Tammer
   <rainer.tammer@spg.schulergroup.com>)

  (Courtesy of Daniel Savard <daniel.savard@gespro.com>)
  (Owner Chris Hall <dylix@home.com>)
- Added a reset Statistics option in the Admin portion of the web
  page.  I didn't modify the default denied URLs to restrict access to
  this options however.
  (Courtesy of Daniel Savard <daniel.savard@gespro.com>)
- Added libwrap support (i.e. ntop now handles /etc/hosts.allow
  /etc/hosts.deny)

  in order to produce "real" graphics
- ntop extensibility via user-defined plugins: so far
  two very simple plugins have been released (arpWatch,
  nfsWatch). Put your plugins (or symbolic links to your
  plugins) into the plugins/ directory.
- DNS packets handling: ntop now decodes DNS replies in
  order to cache sym<->num mappings hence to significantly
  reduce the number of DNS requests

-------------------------------------------------

1.2a4 [Snapshot] (Mon Aug  9 17:59:15 CEST 1999)

Enhancements:
- log file now contains stats about specified IP protocols
  (Owner: Laurent Doublein <Laurent.Doublein@par.sita.int>)
- Users can now specify the mapping  MAC addr <-> symbolic
  names for non-IP hosts. Under utils/ there's a new utility
  called 'addMacAddress' that allows to do that. See the
  utils/README file for further info.

Fixed bugs:
- "tun0" interface is now properly recognized as
   a PPP interface under FreeBSD

- added country icons
- added OS icons
- added CGI (Common Gateway Interface) support.
  Everything under /cgi/ is considered a cgi-like
  script.
- Rewritten user/password support: pw are not stored into
  a databse in encrypted form. Administrators can protect
  with password selected URLs. All the administration is
  performed with ntop. The default administrator user
  is 'admin' with password 'admin'. Make sure you change
  these default settings for your own security.

Fixed bugs:
- lsof/neped data now work again

-------------------------------------------------

1.2a2 [Snapshot]

Enhancements:
- ntop.cache has been replaced by ntop.db

  with GDBM support.
- Added Internet Domain Statistics
 (Owner: Frank Pinzin <frank.pinzin1@sheridanc.on.ca>)
- Symbolic Internet addresses are now mapped to
  lowercase letters
- Added 'delayed' free: host's memory free is delayed in

  is reverted
- Added (basic) FDDI support
  (Owners:
  Ron Campbell <Ron.Campbell@unixa.nerc-wallingford.ac.uk>
  Graeme Wilford <G.Wilford@ee.surrey.ac.uk>)
- Added RH 6.0 pcap support

Fixed bugs:
- Some hash tables had wrong garbage collector code. In
  particular this caused the main table become full. This
  was the main cause of performance degradation due to
  large lookup times.
- red.gif is now sent properly (the HTTP header format
  used to be of wrong type)
- Added missing "<center>" tag on the throughput
  graph.

--------------------------------

  was broken (the Makefile was trying to instell ntop.1 instead
  of ntop.8). In addition the man page had a small
  typo. (thanks to Igor Schein <igor@txc.com>).
- The code that calculates the network usage percentage is
  wrong: the data sent/received percentages are inverted.
