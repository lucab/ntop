<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>ntop</B>

shows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts that are
currently using the network and reports information concerning the (IP and non-IP) 
traffic generated by each host. 
<B>ntop</B>

can be started either in a terminal window (see
<B>intop</B>

) or in
web mode. In the latter case, a web browser is needed to use the
program. 
<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS</H2>

<P>

-a --access-log-path
By default 
<B>ntop</B>

logs HTTP accesses in the file ntop.access.log in the current directory. Use this flag to specify the path of the file where HTTP accesses will be logged. Each log entry is in Apache-like style. The only difference between Apache and 
<B>ntop</B>

is that
<B>ntop</B>

added a new column has been added. Such column contains the time (in milliseconds) that ntop needed in order to serve the request. 
<P>

-b --disable-decoders
This flag disables protocol decoders (e.g. DNS, NetBIOS). Use it for better performance or if you feel 
<B>ntop</B>

has problem handling some protocols.
<P>

-c --sticky-hosts
By default idle hosts are periodically purged from memory. Use this flag to prevent idle hosts from being purged from memory. NOTE: if idle hosts are kept in memory you can experience severe memory usage.
<P>

-d --daemon
This flag causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. it is started in background and detached from the terminal.
<P>

-e --max-table-rows
Is the maximum number of HTML table rows that
<B>ntop</B>

will display. 
<P>

-f --traffic-dump-file
Specifies the file containing tcpdump captured traffic that has to be used by ntop. Note: if you specify -f ntop will not capture any traffic after the file has been read. This option is mostly used for debug purposes.
<P>

-g --track-local-hosts
Use this flag to tell
<B>ntop </B>

that you do care only about local hosts (use -m to specify local nets). This flag is useful when 
<B>ntop</B>

sees many hosts (e.g. border gateway) but only the local ones need to be tracked.
<P>

-h --help
Print help information for 
<B>ntop</B>

, including usage.
<P>

-i --interface 
Specifies the network interface used by
<B>ntop</B>

If multiple interfaces are used (this feature is available only if ntop is compiled with thread support) they have to be separated with a comma. For instance -i &quot;eth0,lo&quot;. Traffic information obtained by all the interfaces is merged together as if the traffic would have been produced by one interface. Use the -M flag for not merging traffic.
<P>
Win32 note: This is the number of the interface, not it's name. Use ??? to see a list of interfaces.
<P>

-k --filter-expression-in-extra-frame
When this flag is used, the current filter expression is printed in an extra frame and thus always visible.
<P>

-l --pcap-log
Dumps the network traffic captured by ntop in a file in pcap format (useful for debug).
<P>

-m --local-subnets
This flag allows users to specify the subnets whose traffic is considered local. The format is &lt;network address&gt;/&lt;# subnet mask bits&gt;[,&lt;network address&gt;/&lt;# subnet mask bits&gt;]. For instance &quot;131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0&quot;.
<P>

-n --numeric-ip-addresses
This causes
<B>ntop</B>

to show numeric IP addresses instead of the symbolic names. This option can useful 
when the DNS is not present or quite slow.  You can toggle the address format 
(numeric vs. symbolic) by pressing the
<B>n</B>

key while 
<B>ntop</B>

is running.
<P>

-o --no-mac
Specifies the user
<B>ntop</B>

should not trust MAC addresses but just IP addresses. This option is useful whenever ntop is started on an interface where MAC addresses cannot be really trusted (e.g. port/VLAN mirror).
<P>

-p --protocols
It is used to specify the TCP/UDP protocols that
<B>ntop</B>

will monitor. The format is &lt;label&gt;=&lt;protocol list&gt; [, &lt;label&gt;=&lt;protocol list&gt;], where
label is used to symbolically identify the &lt;protocol list&gt;. The format of &lt;protocol list&gt;
is &lt;protocol&gt;[|&lt;protocol&gt;], where &lt;protocol&gt; is either a valid protocol specified inside the
/etc/services file or a numeric port range (e.g. 80, or 6000-6500). If the -p flag is omitted the following 
default value is used: &quot;FTP=ftp|ftp-data,HTTP=http|www|https|3128,DNS=name|domain,Telnet=telnet|login,NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-ssn,Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2,DHCP/BOOTP=67-68,SNMP=snmp|snmp-trap,NNTP=nntp,NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-status,X11=6000-6010,SSH=22,Gnutella=6346|6347|6348,Morpheus=1214,WinMX=6699|7730,Audiogalaxy=41000-41900,Napster=8888|8875&quot; If the &lt;protocol list&gt; is very long you may store in a file (for instance protocol.list) the value of the &lt;protocol list&gt; and specify the file name instead of the &lt;protocol list&gt; (in above example you will invoke 'ntop -p protocol.list').
<P>

-q --create-suspicious-packets
Forces ntop to create a file ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the interface name) for each network interface where are stored suspicious packets. The file is in pcap format (tcpdump).
<P>

-r --refresh-time
Specifies the delay (in seconds) between screen updates (the default is 3 seconds). If the -l flag is used, it specifies how often entries are logged in the log file. Please
note that if the delay is very short (1 second for instance), ntop might not
be able to process all the network traffic.
<P>

-s --no-promiscuous
Use this flag for disabling interface promiscuous mode (i.e. the ability to capture ethernet frames regardless whether they are directed to the local ethernet card or to the ethernet broadcast address). Note that even if you use this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscuous mode as other applications can have enabled this functionality.
*****NOTE: This is not functional in v2.0/2.1 of ntop.  It is a future place-holder ONLY. *****
<P>

-t --trace-level
This flag specifies the level of
<B>ntop</B>

tracings on stdout. The trace level ranges between 0 (no trace) and 5 (full debug tracings). The default trace value is 3. The higher is the trace level the more information are printed. Trace level 1 is used to print errors only, level 2 for both warnings and errors, and so on. 
<P>

-u --user
Specifies the user
<B>ntop</B>

should run as after it initializes. The value specified may be either a
username or a numeric user id. The group id used will be the primary group of
the user specified.
<P>

-w --http-server
<B>ntop</B>

sports an embedded web server so that users can attach their web browsers to the specified port and browse 
traffic information remotely. Supposing to start
<B>ntop</B>

at the port 
<B>3000 </B>

(default port), the URL to access is
<A HREF="http://hostname:3000/.">http://hostname:3000/.</A> Users and URLs to protect with passwords are
stored in a database file. By default user/URL administration
are accessible uniquely by the user 
<B>admin</B>

with password
<B>admin</B>


Passwords are stored in an encrypted form into the database for
further security. Please note that an HTTP server is NOT
needed but it's embedded into the application. If -w is set to 0 the HTTP port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is accepted only if 
<B>ntop</B>

<BR>&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;compiled&nbsp;with&nbsp;HTTPS&nbsp;support&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<B>ntop </B>

has not been started with '-W 0' [see below]).
You can also use the IP:Port notation to bind ntop to the specified IP-Address, e.g.
<B>-w 127.0.0.1:3000</B>

<P>

-z --disable-sessions
This flag disables TCP session tracking. Use it for better performance or when you don't really care of tracking sessions.
<P>

-A --set-admin-password

-A and --set-admin-password (without a value) will prompt the user.
You may set a specific value using --set-admin-password=value.  The = is REQUIRED!
<P>

-B --filter-expression
<B>ntop</B>

, similar to what tcpdump does, allows users to specify an expression
that restricts the type of traffic handled by
<B>ntop</B>

hence to select only the traffic of interest. For instance, suppose to
be interested only in the traffic generated/received by the host
jake.unipi.it. 
<B>ntop</B>

can then be started with the following filter: 'ntop src host jake.unipi.it 
or dst host jake.unipi.it'. See the
<B>tcpdump</B>

man page for further information about this topic.
<P>

-C --large-network
This flag is a hint for ntop: as the network to analyze will be large, ntop will build a more efficient hash and save memory for some features (e.g traffic distribution during the day) that take up quite some memory.
<P>

-D --domain
This identifies the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org, if
<B>ntop</B>

is having difficulty determining it from the interface.
<P>

-E --enable-external-tools
By default ntop does not take advance of lsof/nmap even if present. Use this flag if you want make ntop aware of such tools (if present).
<P>

-F --flow-spec
It is used to specify network flows similar to more powerful applications such as NeTraMet. A flow is a stream of captured packets that match a specified rule. The format is &lt;flow-label&gt;='&lt;matching expression&gt;'[,&lt;flow-label&gt;='&lt;matching expression&gt;'], where the label is used to symbolically identify the flow specified by the expression. The expression format is specified in the appendix. If an expression is specified, then the information concerning flows can be accessed following the HTML link named 'List NetFlows'.
For instance suppose to define two flows with the following expression &quot;LucaHosts='host jake.unipi.it or host pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRoutedPkts='gateway gateway.unipi.it'&quot;. All the traffic sent/received by hosts jake.unipi.it or pisanino.unipi.it is collected by
<B>ntop</B>

and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all the packet routed by the gateway gateway.unipi.it are added to the GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list is very long you may store in a file (for instance flows.list) the list of flows and specify the file name instead of the flows list (in above example you will invoke 'ntop -F flows.list').
<P>

-K --enable-debug
Use this flag to simplify application debug.  It does three things:
1. Does not fork() on the &quot;read only&quot; html pages.
2. Displays mutex values on the configuration (info.html) page.
3. (If available - glibc/gcc) Activates an automated backtrace on application errors.
<P>

-L --use-syslog=facility
Use this flag for using the syslog instead of stdout. Please note that if ntop (ever) forks a child, in any case the syslog will be used for this child.
The (optional) parameter value indicates the facility (e.g. daemon, security) to be used for logging, using --use-syslog=facility. The = is REQUIRED!
<P>

-M --no-interface-merge
Forces ntop not to merge network interfaces together. This means that ntop will collect statistics for each interface and will not merge data together.
<P>

-N --no-nmap
Forces ntop not to use nmap (if it is installed).
<P>

-O --output-packet-path
Base path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and normal packet log file (tcpdump). If the base
path is a directory you have to append a / to the string for this to work fine.
<P>

-P --db-file-path
This allows to specify where db-files are searched or created (default &quot;.&quot;). In addition DBPATH/html is added to the searchlist for the WEB-files
<P>

-U --mapper
It specifies the UTR of the mapper.pl utility (it's part of the ntop distribution [see www/Perl/mapper.pl]) for displaying host location. If you don't want to install a mapper use <A HREF="http://jake.ntop.org/cgi-bin/mapper.pl">http://jake.ntop.org/cgi-bin/mapper.pl</A>
<P>

-V --version
Prints 
<B>ntop </B>

version information and then exits.
<P>

-W --https-server
If 
<B>ntop</B>

has been compiled with HTTPS support (via OpenSSL), this flag can be used to set the HTTPS port (default 
<B>3001</B>

). If the user specifies '-W 0', HTTPS support is disabled. Some examples: 1. 
<B>ntop -w 80 -W 443 </B>

(both HTTP and HTTPS have been enabled at their default ports) 2. 
<B>ntop -w 0 -W 443 </B>

(HTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled at the default port).
You can also use the IP:Port notation to bind ntop to the specified IP-Address, e.g.
<B>-w 127.0.0.1:3001</B>

<P>

--throughput-bar-chart
Format the throughput charts with bars instead of as an area chart.
<P>

--dynamic-purge-limits
Enable a dynamic adjustment of the idle host purge limits.  Normally the purge is limited
to 1/3 of the hash size or 512 hosts (whichever is smaller) per cycle.  This switch allows
ntop to dynamically adjust the limit so that the purge takes between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds
(but the minimum dynamic limit is 64 per cycle).  These values may be adjusted via compile
time constants.
<P>
It --reuse-rrd-graphics
Enable the reuse of rrd graphics if appropriate (no rrd updates in the interim).  The default, the flag not set, is that the graphics are recreated for each request.
<P>

--ignore-sigpipe                                    
Enable a handler for SIGPIPE errors. This usually happens only under debug (gdb).
(also available as a ./configure option, --enable-ignoresigpipe)
<P>

--use-sslwatchdog
Enable a watchdog for ntop webserver hangs.  These usually happen when connecting
with Netscape 6.2.2 and other browsers - only via https:// urls.  The user gets 
nothing back and other users can't connect.  Internally, the web server hangs in 
SSL_accept().  While packet processing continues, there is no way to access the 
data through the web server or shutdown ntop cleanly.  With the watchdog, a
timeout occurs after 3 seconds, and processing continues with a log message.
Unfortunately, the user sees nothing - it just looks like a failed connection.
(also available as a ./configure option, --enable-sslwatchdog)
<P>

<H2>WEB VIEWS</H2>

While
<B>ntop</B>

is running, multiple users can access the traffic information using conventional web browsers. The main HTML page, is divided is two frames. The left frame allows users to select the traffic view that will be displayed in the right frame. Available sections are: sort traffic by data sent, sort traffic by data received, traffic statistics, active hosts list, remote to local (i.e. inside the subnet defined for the network board from which the program is currently sniffing) IP traffic, local to remote IP traffic, local to local IP traffic, list of active TCP sessions, IP protocol distribution statistics, IP protocol usage, IP traffic matrix.
