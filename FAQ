  FAQ

Q. How can I run ntop without being root?
A. A very simple way of doing this is:
   > su
   > chown root ntop
   > chgrp root ntop
   > chmod 6111 ntop
   > exit

Q. I can't run ntop on BSD systems. The error is:
   ntop: /dev/bpf0: Device not configured
A. This is because bfp0 has not been configured inside the generic
   kernel config file. If you use generic kernel config file put
   pseudo-device bpfilter 16
   to kernel config file and rebuild the kernel.

Q. ntop doesn't report any traffic at all.
A. Please make sure that there's traffic on the interface you're using. You
   can select an interface using the '-i' flag.

Q. Where can I find pthreads for IRIX 6.2?
A. Irix 6.2 doesn't support POSIX threads out of the box. You must
   install the patch: 2791

Q. Where can I find lsof?
A. You can download lsof from
   ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof

Q. How do I force configure to build ntop without
   lsof support?
A. configure -enable-lsof=no

Q. How do I force configure to build ntop without
   thread support?
A. configure -enable-threads=no

Q. How do I install the ntop package on Solaris?
A. For instance do 'pkgadd -d ntop-1.1-solaris.i386'

Q. ntop doesn't seem to collect any data on Digital Unix.
A. Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com> said:
First, to compile, make sure you don't use '-std1' which will cause problems
compiling pbuf.c. '-std' is ok.

Once ntop is compiled, do the following:
        1. Make sure 'options PACKETFILTER' is in your kernel
           configuration file under /sys/conf. Recompile the
           kernel using 'doconfig -c [config file]' if necessary.
        2. % cd /dev
           % ./MAKEDEV pfilt
           % pfconfig +promisc [interface]

The last part of #2 I didn't do so ntop did not collect any data.

Q. Where can I find neped/queso?
A. You can download neped/queso from http://www.apostols.org/

Q. Where can I find GDBM for Windows?
A. http://www.roth.net/libs/gdbm/

Q. I have experienced problems defining multiple filters: ntop reports
   'syntax error'. What shall I do?
A. If you believe the filter is syntactically correct then it's likely
   that the libpcap you have used has been compiled using an old
   non-reentrant version of flex. Please make sure you're using
   version 2.5.4 or above.

Q. Linux: ntop isn't able to capture data.
A. On some Linux distributions, the libpcap package is broken. Please
   remove it, get the source, build libpcap and install it
   (both the library and the include files). The rebuild ntop from
   scratch.


Q. AIX: I've linked ntop against the special libcap library that's
   available on the ntop sire. Unfortunately ntop doesn't work. It
   fails with the following error:
   # ./ntop

   strload -f /etc/dlpi.conf.
