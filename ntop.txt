DESCRIPTION
       ntop  shows  the current network usage. It displays a list
       of hosts that are currently using the network and  reports
       information  concerning the (IP and non-IP) traffic gener-
       ated by each host.  ntop can be started either in a termi-
       nal  window  (see  intop  )  or in web mode. In the latter
       case, a web browser is needed to use the program.



COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -a | --access-log-path
        By  default  ntop  logs  HTTP  accesses   in   the   file
        ntop.access.log  in  the current directory. Use this flag
        to specify the path of the file where HTTP accesses  will
        be  logged.  Each  log entry is in Apache-like style. The
        only difference between Apache  and  ntop  is  that  ntop
        added  a  new column has been added. Such column contains
        the time (in milliseconds) that ntop needed in  order  to
        serve the request.


       -b | --disable-decoders
        This flag disables protocol decoders (e.g. DNS, NetBIOS).
        Use it for better performance or if  you  feel  ntop  has
        problem handling some protocols.


       -c | --sticky-hosts
        By  default  idle hosts are periodically purged from mem-
        ory. Use this flag  to  prevent  idle  hosts  from  being
        purged  from memory. NOTE: if idle hosts are kept in mem-
        ory you can experience severe memory usage.


       -d | --daemon
        This flag causes ntop to become  a  daemon,  i.e.  it  is
        started in background and detached from the terminal.


       -e | --max-table-rows
        Is  the  maximum number of HTML table rows that ntop will
        display.


       -f | --traffic-dump-file
        Specifies the file containing  tcpdump  captured  traffic
        that has to be used by ntop. Note: if you specify -f ntop
        will not capture any traffic  after  the  file  has  been
        read. This option is mostly used for debug purposes.


       -g | --track-local-hosts
        Use  this  flag  to tell ntop that you do care only about
        local hosts (use -m to specify local nets). This flag  is
        useful  when  ntop  sees many hosts (e.g. border gateway)
        but only the local ones need to be tracked.


       -h | --help
        Print help information for ntop , including usage.


       -i | --interface
        Specifies the network interface used by ntop If  multiple
        interfaces  are  used  (this feature is available only if
        ntop is compiled with thread support)  they  have  to  be
        separated  with a comma. For instance -i "eth0,lo". Traf-
        fic information obtained by all the interfaces is  merged
        together  as  if  the traffic would have been produced by
        one interface. Use the -M flag for not merging traffic.

        Win32 note: This is the number of the interface, not it's
        name. Use ??? to see a list of interfaces.


       -k | --filter-expression-in-extra-frame
        When  this flag is used, the current filter expression is
        printed in an extra frame and thus always visible.


       -l | --pcap-log
        Dumps the network traffic captured by ntop in a  file  in
        pcap format (useful for debug).


       -m | --local-subnets
        This flag allows users to specify the subnets whose traf-
        fic  is  considered  local.  The   format   is   <network
        address>/<#  subnet mask bits>[,<network address>/<# sub-
        net        mask        bits>].        For        instance
        "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".


       -n | --numeric-ip-addresses
        This  causes ntop to show numeric IP addresses instead of
        the symbolic names. This option can useful when  the  DNS
        is not present or quite slow.  You can toggle the address
        format (numeric vs. symbolic) by pressing the n key while
        ntop is running.


       -o | --no-mac
        Specifies  the  user  ntop should not trust MAC addresses
        but just IP addresses. This  option  is  useful  whenever
        ntop  is started on an interface where MAC addresses can-
        not be really trusted (e.g. port/VLAN mirror).


       -p | --protocols
        It is used to specify the  TCP/UDP  protocols  that  ntop
        will  monitor.  The  format is <label>=<protocol list> [,
        <label>=<protocol list>], where label is used to symboli-
        cally identify the <protocol list>. The format of <proto-
        col list> is <protocol>[|<protocol>], where <protocol> is
        either  a  valid  protocol specified inside the /etc/ser-
        vices  file  or  a  numeric  port  range  (e.g.  80,   or
        6000-6500).  If  the  -p  flag  is  omitted the following
        default      value      is      used:       "FTP=ftp|ftp-
        data,HTTP=http|www|https|3128,DNS=name|domain,Telnet=tel-
        net|login,NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-
        ssn,Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2,DHCP/BOOTP=67-68,SNMP=snmp|snmp-
        trap,NNTP=nntp,NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-sta-
        tus,X11=6000-6010,SSH=22,Gnutella=6346|6347|6348,Mor-
        pheus=1214,WinMX=6699|7730,Audiogalaxy=41000-41900,Nap-
        ster=8888|8875"  If  the <protocol list> is very long you
        may store in a  file  (for  instance  protocol.list)  the
        value  of  the  <protocol list> and specify the file name
        instead of the <protocol list> (in above example you will
        invoke 'ntop -p protocol.list').


       -q | --create-suspicious-packets
        Forces   ntop   to   create   a   file   ntop-suspicious-
        pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the interface name) for  each  net-
        work  interface  where are stored suspicious packets. The
        file is in pcap format (tcpdump).


       -r | --refresh-time
        Specifies the delay (in seconds) between  screen  updates
        (the  default  is  3 seconds). If the -l flag is used, it
        specifies how often entries are logged in the  log  file.
        Please note that if the delay is very short (1 second for
        instance), ntop might not be able to process all the net-
        work traffic.


       -s | --no-promiscuous
        Use  this  flag  for disabling interface promiscuous mode
        (i.e. the ability to capture ethernet  frames  regardless
        whether  they  are directed to the local ethernet card or
        to the ethernet broadcast address). Note that even if you
        use  this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscu-
        ous mode as other  applications  can  have  enabled  this
        functionality.   *****NOTE:  This  is  not  functional in
        v2.0/2.1 of ntop.  It  is  a  future  place-holder  ONLY.
        *****


       -t | --trace-level
        This flag specifies the level of ntop tracings on stdout.
        The trace level ranges between 0 (no trace) and  5  (full
        debug tracings). The default trace value is 3. The higher
        is the trace level  the  more  information  are  printed.
        Trace  level  1 is used to print errors only, level 2 for
        both warnings and errors, and so on.


       -u | --user
        Specifies the user ntop should run as after  it  initial-
        izes.  The  value specified may be either a username or a
        numeric user id. The group id used will  be  the  primary
        group of the user specified.


       -w | --http-server
        ntop  sports  an  embedded  web  server so that users can
        attach their web  browsers  to  the  specified  port  and
        browse  traffic  information remotely. Supposing to start
        ntop at the port 3000 (default port), the URL  to  access
        is  http://hostname:3000/. Users and URLs to protect with
        passwords are stored  in  a  database  file.  By  default
        user/URL  administration  are  accessible uniquely by the
        user admin with password admin Passwords are stored in an
        encrypted  form  into  the database for further security.
        Please note that an HTTP server is NOT  needed  but  it's
        embedded into the application. If -w is set to 0 the HTTP
        port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is accepted only if ntop
         has  been  compiled  with HTTPS support and ntop has not
        been started with '-W 0' [see below]).  You can also  use
        the  IP:Port  notation  to bind ntop to the specified IP-
        Address, e.g.  -w 127.0.0.1:3000


       -z | --disable-sessions
        This flag disables TCP session tracking. Use it for  bet-
        ter performance or when you don't really care of tracking
        sessions.


       -A | --set-admin-password
        -A and --set-admin-password (without a value) will prompt
        the  user.   You  may  set  a specific value using --set-
        admin-password=value.  The = is REQUIRED!


       -B | --filter-expression
        ntop , similar to what  tcpdump  does,  allows  users  to
        specify  an expression that restricts the type of traffic
        handled by ntop hence  to  select  only  the  traffic  of
        interest.  For instance, suppose to be interested only in
        the traffic generated/received by the host jake.unipi.it.
        ntop can then be started with the following filter: 'ntop
        src host jake.unipi.it or dst  host  jake.unipi.it'.  See
        the  tcpdump  man page for further information about this
        topic.


       -C | --large-network
        This flag is a hint for ntop: as the network  to  analyze
        will  be large, ntop will build a more efficient hash and
        save memory for some features (e.g  traffic  distribution
        during the day) that take up quite some memory.


       -D | --domain
        This  identifies  the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org,
        if ntop is having  difficulty  determining  it  from  the
        interface.


       -E | --enable-external-tools
        By  default  ntop does not take advance of lsof/nmap even
        if present. Use this flag if you want make ntop aware  of
        such tools (if present).


       -F | --flow-spec
        It  is used to specify network flows similar to more pow-
        erful applications such as NeTraMet. A flow is  a  stream
        of captured packets that match a specified rule. The for-
        mat   is   <flow-label>='<matching   expression>'[,<flow-
        label>='<matching  expression>'], where the label is used
        to  symbolically  identify  the  flow  specified  by  the
        expression.  The  expression  format  is specified in the
        appendix. If an expression is specified, then the  infor-
        mation  concerning  flows  can  be accessed following the
        HTML link named 'List NetFlows'.  For instance suppose to
        define  two  flows  with  the following expression "Luca-
        Hosts='host         jake.unipi.it         or         host
        pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRoutedPkts='gateway       gate-
        way.unipi.it'". All the traffic  sent/received  by  hosts
        jake.unipi.it  or  pisanino.unipi.it is collected by ntop
        and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all  the  packet
        routed  by  the gateway gateway.unipi.it are added to the
        GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list  is  very  long
        you  may  store  in  a file (for instance flows.list) the
        list of flows and specify the file name  instead  of  the
        flows  list  (in  above  example you will invoke 'ntop -F
        flows.list').


       -K | --enable-debug
        Use this flag to simplify  application  debug.   It  does
        three  things: 1. Does not fork() on the "read only" html
        pages.  2. Displays mutex  values  on  the  configuration
        (info.html)  page.   3.  (If available - glibc/gcc) Acti-
        vates an automated backtrace on application errors.


       -L | --use-syslog=facility
        Use this flag for using the  syslog  instead  of  stdout.
        Please  note  that  if  ntop (ever) forks a child, in any
        case the  syslog  will  be  used  for  this  child.   The
        (optional)  parameter  value indicates the facility (e.g.
        daemon, security) to be used for  logging,  using  --use-
        syslog=facility. The = is REQUIRED!


       -M | --no-interface-merge
        Forces  ntop  not  to  merge network interfaces together.
        This means that ntop will  collect  statistics  for  each
        interface and will not merge data together.


       -N | --no-nmap
        Forces ntop not to use nmap (if it is installed).


       -O | --output-packet-path
        Base  path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and nor-
        mal packet log file (tcpdump). If  the  base  path  is  a
        directory  you  have to append a / to the string for this
        to work fine.


       -P | --db-file-path
        This allows to specify where  db-files  are  searched  or
        created  (default  "."). In addition DBPATH/html is added
        to the searchlist for the WEB-files


       -U | --mapper
        It specifies the UTR of the mapper.pl utility (it's  part
        of  the  ntop  distribution [see www/Perl/mapper.pl]) for
        displaying host location. If you don't want to install  a
        mapper use http://jake.ntop.org/cgi-bin/mapper.pl


       -V | --version
        Prints ntop version information and then exits.


       -W | --https-server
        If  ntop  has  been  compiled  with  HTTPS  support  (via
        OpenSSL), this flag can be used to  set  the  HTTPS  port
        (default 3001 ). If the user specifies '-W 0', HTTPS sup-
        port is disabled. Some examples: 1.  ntop -w  80  -W  443
        (both  HTTP  and HTTPS have been enabled at their default
        ports) 2.  ntop -w 0 -W 443 (HTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled
        at the default port).  You can also use the IP:Port nota-
        tion to bind ntop to the specified IP-Address,  e.g.   -w
        127.0.0.1:3001


       --throughput-bar-chart
        Format  the  throughput charts with bars instead of as an
        area chart.


       --dynamic-purge-limits
        Enable a dynamic adjustment of the idle host  purge  lim-
        its.   Normally  the  purge is limited to 1/3 of the hash
        size or 512 hosts (whichever is smaller) per cycle.  This
        switch  allows  ntop  to  dynamically adjust the limit so
        that the purge takes between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds (but the
        minimum dynamic limit is 64 per cycle).  These values may
        be adjusted via compile time constants.

        It --reuse-rrd-graphics Enable the reuse of rrd  graphics
        if  appropriate  (no  rrd  updates  in the interim).  The
        default, the flag not  set,  is  that  the  graphics  are
        recreated for each request.


       --ignore-sigpipe
        Enable a handler for SIGPIPE errors. This usually happens
        only under debug (gdb).  (also available as a ./configure
        option, --enable-ignoresigpipe)


       --use-sslwatchdog
        Enable  a  watchdog for ntop webserver hangs.  These usu-
        ally happen when connecting with Netscape 6.2.2 and other
        browsers - only via https:// urls.  The user gets nothing
        back and other users can't connect.  Internally, the  web
        server  hangs  in  SSL_accept().  While packet processing
        continues, there is no way to access the data through the
        web  server or shutdown ntop cleanly.  With the watchdog,
        a timeout occurs after 3 seconds, and processing  contin-
        ues  with  a  log  message.  Unfortunately, the user sees
        nothing - it just looks like a failed connection.   (also
        available as a ./configure option, --enable-sslwatchdog)


WEB VIEWS
       While ntop is running, multiple users can access the traf-
       fic information using conventional web browsers. The  main
       HTML page, is divided is two frames. The left frame allows
       users to select the traffic view that will be displayed in
       the  right  frame. Available sections are: sort traffic by
       data sent, sort traffic by data received, traffic  statis-
       tics,  active hosts list, remote to local (i.e. inside the
       subnet defined for the network board from which  the  pro-
       gram is currently sniffing) IP traffic, local to remote IP
       traffic, local to local IP traffic,  list  of  active  TCP
       sessions, IP protocol distribution statistics, IP protocol
       usage, IP traffic matrix.
