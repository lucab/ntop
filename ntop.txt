DESCRIPTION
       ntop shows the current network usage. It displays  a  list
       of  hosts that are currently using the network and reports
       information concerning the (IP and non-IP) traffic  gener-
       ated by each host.  ntop can be started either in a termi-
       nal window (see intop ) or in  web  mode.  In  the  latter
       case, a web browser is needed to use the program.

NTOP(8)                                                   NTOP(8)


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -a | --access-log-path
        By   default   ntop   logs  HTTP  accesses  in  the  file
        ntop.access.log in the current directory. Use  this  flag
        to  specify the path of the file where HTTP accesses will
        be logged. Each log entry is in  Apache-like  style.  The
        only  difference  between Apache and ntop is that .B ntop
        added a new column has been added. Such  column  contains
        the  time  (in milliseconds) that ntop needed in order to
        serve the request.


       -b | --sql-host
        Exports ntop traffic information into a SQL database. The
        flag  specifies  (in  http-like  host format) the address
        (IP:port) of a SQL client. The database/  directory  part
        of  ntop contains a few clients. Please use one of those.


       -c | --sticky-hosts
        By default idle hosts are periodically purged  from  mem-
        ory.  Use  this  flag  to  prevent  idle hosts from being
        purged from memory. NOTE: if idle hosts are kept in  mem-
        ory you can experience severe memory usage.


       -d | --daemon
        This  flag  causes  ntop  to  become a daemon, i.e. it is
        started in background and detached from the terminal.


       -e | --max-table-rows
        Is the maximum number of HTML table rows that  ntop  will
        display.


       -f | --traffic-dump-file
        Specifies  the  file  containing tcpdump captured traffic
        that has to be used by ntop. Note: if you specify -f ntop
        will  not  capture  any  traffic  after the file has been
        read. This option is mostly used for debug purposes.


       -g | --cisco-netflow-host
        Exports ntop traffic  information  in  Cisco  NetFlow  V5
        (http://www.cisco.com/warp/pub-
        lic/cc/pd/iosw/ioft/neflct/tech/napps_wp.htm) format. The
        flag  specifies  (in  http-like  host format) the address
        (IP:port) of a NetFlow client such as ftp://ftp.net.ohio-
        state.edu/users/maf/cisco/.


       -h | --help
        Print help information for ntop , including usage.

NTOP(8)                                                   NTOP(8)


       -i | --interface
        Specifies  the network interface used by ntop If multiple
        interfaces are used (this feature is  available  only  if
        ntop  is  compiled  with  thread support) they have to be
        separated with a comma. For instance -i "eth0,lo".  Traf-
        fic  information obtained by all the interfaces is merged
        together as if the traffic would have  been  produced  by
        one interface. Use the -M flag for not merging traffic.

        Win32 note: This is the number of the interface, not it's
        name. Use ??? to see a list of interfaces.


       -j | --border-sniffer-mode
        When this flag is used, ntop is supposed to be  installed
        on  a  line  where  traffic  is mirrored from a switch or
        another network appliance.


       -k | --filter-expression-in-extra-frame
        When this flag is used, the current filter expression  is
        printed in an extra frame and thus always visible.


       -l | --pcap-log
        Dumps  the  network traffic captured by ntop in a file in
        pcap format (useful for debug).


       -m | --local-subnets
        This flag allows users to specify the subnets whose traf-
        fic   is   considered   local.  The  format  is  <network
        address>/<# subnet mask bits>[,<network address>/<#  sub-
        net        mask        bits>].        For        instance
        "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".


       -n | --numeric-ip-addresses
        This causes ntop to show numeric IP addresses instead  of
        the  symbolic  names. This option can useful when the DNS
        is not present or quite slow.  You can toggle the address
        format (numeric vs. symbolic) by pressing the n key while
        ntop is running.


       -p | --protocols
        It is used to specify the  TCP/UDP  protocols  that  ntop
        will  monitor.  The  format is <label>=<protocol list> [,
        <label>=<protocol list>], where label is used to symboli-
        cally identify the <protocol list>. The format of <proto-
        col list> is <protocol>[|<protocol>], where <protocol> is
        either  a  valid  protocol specified inside the /etc/ser-
        vices  file  or  a  numeric  port  range  (e.g.  80,   or
        6000-6500).  If  the  -p  flag  is  omitted the following

NTOP(8)                                                   NTOP(8)


        default      value      is      used:       "FTP=ftp|ftp-
        data,HTTP=http|www|https,DNS=name|domain,Telnet=tel-
        net|login,NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-
        ssn,Mail=pop-2|pop-3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2,SNMP=snmp|snmp-
        trap,NEWS=nntp,NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfs|nfsd-sta-
        tus,X11=6000-6010,SSH=ssh".  If  the  <protocol  list> is
        very long you may store in a file  (for  instance  proto-
        col.list)  the  value  of the <protocol list> and specify
        the file name instead of the <protocol  list>  (in  above
        example you will invoke 'ntop -p protocol.list').


       -q | --create-suspicious-packets
        Forces   ntop   to   create   a   file   ntop-suspicious-
        pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the interface name) for  each  net-
        work  interface  where are stored suspicious packets. The
        file is in pcap format (tcpdump).


       -r | --refresh-time
        Specifies the delay (in seconds) between  screen  updates
        (the  default  is  3 seconds). If the -l flag is used, it
        specifies how often entries are logged in the  log  file.
        Please note that if the delay is very short (1 second for
        instance), ntop might not be able to process all the net-
        work traffic.


       -s | --no-promiscuous
        Use  this  flag  for disabling interface promiscuous mode
        (i.e. the ability to capture ethernet  frames  regardless
        whether  they  are directed to the local ethernet card or
        to the ethernet broadcast address). Note that even if you
        use  this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscu-
        ous mode as other  applications  can  have  enabled  this
        functionality.


       -t | --trace-level
        This flag specifies the level of ntop tracings on stdout.
        The trace level ranges between 0 (no trace) and  5  (full
        debug tracings). The default trace value is 3. The higher
        is the trace level  the  more  information  are  printed.
        Trace  level  1 is used to print errors only, level 2 for
        both warnings and errors, and so on.


       -u | --user
        Specifies the user ntop should run as after  it  initial-
        izes.  The  value specified may be either a username or a
        numeric user id. The group id used will  be  the  primary
        group of the user specified.

NTOP(8)                                                   NTOP(8)


       -v | --mysql-host
        Specifies   the  mySQL  database  connection  information
        (user:password:database:host).


       -w | --http-server
        ntop sports and embedded web server  so  that  users  can
        attach  their  web  browsers  to  the  specified port and
        browse traffic information remotely. Supposing  to  start
        ntop  at  the port 3000 (default port), the URL to access
        is http://hostname:3000/. Users and URLs to protect  with
        passwords  are  stored  in  a  database  file. By default
        user/URL administration are accessible  uniquely  by  the
        user admin with password admin Passwords are stored in an
        encrypted form into the database  for  further  security.
        Please  note  that  an HTTP server is NOT needed but it's
        embedded into the application. If -w is set to 0 the HTTP
        port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is accepted only if ntop
         has been compiled with HTTPS support and  ntop  has  not
        been  started with '-W 0' [see below]).  You can also use
        the IP:Port notation to bind ntop to  the  specified  IP-
        Address, e.g.  -w 127.0.0.1:3000


       -B | --filter-expression
        ntop  ,  similar  to  what  tcpdump does, allows users to
        specify an expression that restricts the type of  traffic
        handled  by  ntop  hence  to  select  only the traffic of
        interest. For instance, suppose to be interested only  in
        the traffic generated/received by the host jake.unipi.it.
        ntop can then be started with the following filter: 'ntop
        src  host  jake.unipi.it  or dst host jake.unipi.it'. See
        the tcpdump man page for further information  about  this
        topic.


       -D | --domain
        This  identifies  the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org,
        if ntop is having  difficulty  determining  it  from  the
        interface.


       -E | --enable-external-tools
        By  default  ntop does not take advance of lsof/nmap even
        if present. Use this flag if you want make ntop aware  of
        such tools (if present).


       -F | --flow-spec
        It  is used to specify network flows similar to more pow-
        erful applications such as NeTraMet. A flow is  a  stream
        of captured packets that match a specified rule. The for-
        mat   is   <flow-label>='<matching   expression>'[,<flow-
        label>='<matching  expression>'], where the label is used

        to  symbolically  identify  the  flow  specified  by  the
        expression.  The  expression  format  is specified in the
        appendix. If an expression is specified, then the  infor-
        mation  concerning  flows  can  be accessed following the
        HTML link named 'List NetFlows'.  For instance suppose to
        define  two  flows  with  the following expression "Luca-
        Hosts='host         jake.unipi.it         or         host
        pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRoutedPkts='gateway       gate-
        way.unipi.it'". All the traffic  sent/received  by  hosts
        jake.unipi.it  or  pisanino.unipi.it is collected by ntop
        and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all  the  packet
        routed  by  the gateway gateway.unipi.it are added to the
        GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list  is  very  long
        you  may  store  in  a file (for instance flows.list) the
        list of flows and specify the file name  instead  of  the
        flows  list  (in  above  example you will invoke 'ntop -F
        flows.list').


       -K | --enable-debug
        Use this flag to simplify application debug  (eg.  fork()
        is not used etc.)


       -L | --enable-syslog
        Use  this  flag  for  using the syslog instead of stdout.
        Please note that if ntop (ever) forks  a  child,  in  any
        case the syslog will be used for this child.


       -M | --no-interface-merge
        Forces  ntop  not  to  merge network interfaces together.
        This means that ntop will  collect  statistics  for  each
        interface and will not merge data together.


       -N | --no-nmap
        Forces ntop not to use nmap (if it is installed).


       -O | --output-packet-path
        Base  path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and nor-
        mal packet log file (tcpdump). If  the  base  path  is  a
        directory  you  have to append a / to the string for this
        to work fine.


       -P | --db-file-path
        This allows to specify where  db-files  are  searched  or
        created  (default  "."). In addition DBPATH/html is added
        to the searchlist for the WEB-files

NTOP(8)                                                   NTOP(8)


       -S | --store-mode
        Use this flag for telling ntop to save information  about
        host  traffic  on  shutdown.  Valid values are: 0 = don't
        store hosts, 1 = store all hosts, 2 =  store  only  local
        hosts.  This  flag allows ntop not to loose traffic stats
        across multiple ntop sessions. Please note that  informa-
        tion about TCP session is (obviously) lost.


       -U | --mapper
        It  specifies the UTR of the mapper.pl utility (it's part
        of the ntop distribution  [see  www/Perl/mapper.pl])  for
        displaying  host location. If you don't want to install a
        mapper use http://jake.ntop.org/cgi-bin/mapper.pl


       -V | --version
        Prints ntop version information and then exits.


       -W | --https-server
        If  ntop  has  been  compiled  with  HTTPS  support  (via
        OpenSSL),  this  flag  can  be used to set the HTTPS port
        (default 3001 ). If the user specifies '-W 0', HTTPS sup-
        port  is  disabled.  Some examples: 1.  ntop -w 80 -W 443
        (both HTTP and HTTPS have been enabled at  their  default
        ports) 2.  ntop -w 0 -W 443 (HTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled
        at the default port).  You can also use the IP:Port nota-
        tion  to  bind ntop to the specified IP-Address, e.g.  -w
        127.0.0.1:3001


       -1 | --no-throughput-update
        Turns off the calculation by ntop of the minute by minute
        throughput of the network(s).


       -2 | --no-idle-hosts
        Turns  off  the  periodic  purging of idle hosts from the
        tables.


       --throughput-bar-chart
        Format the throughput charts with bars instead of  as  an
        area chart.


       --no-admin-password-hint
        Supppresses  the  hint about the (default) admin password
        in the dialog boxes.


WEB VIEWS
       While ntop is  running,  multiple  users  can  access  the

       traffic  information  using conventional web browsers. The
       main HTML page, is divided is two frames. The  left  frame
       allows  users to select the traffic view that will be dis-
       played in the right frame. Available  sections  are:  sort
       traffic by data sent, sort traffic by data received, traf-
       fic statistics, active hosts list, remote to  local  (i.e.
       inside the subnet defined for the network board from which
       the program is currently sniffing) IP  traffic,  local  to
       remote  IP  traffic,  local  to  local IP traffic, list of
       active TCP sessions, IP protocol distribution  statistics,
       IP protocol usage, IP traffic matrix.
